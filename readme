this is a from the ground up sbt project, to test swt/jface with scala
don't want an ide getting in the way yet
run the sbt package to get the jar made in /target/scala-2.13/
have made launcher script called run_kernai.sh
this kicks of java -jar and passes the necessary class files
note all dependencies are in the lib folder, at least the unmanaged ones
